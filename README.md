# UI5 Boilerplate - Fiori Edition

UI5 Boilerplate - Fiori Edition is a template for building Apps based on OpenUI5 or SAPUI5, which can be integrated into the SAP Fiori Launchpad. 
The UI5 Boilerplate uses the sap.m.SplitApp which itself is especially designed for tablet usage (iPad), but is also usable on smartphones with iOS and Android (iPhone 4s/5/5s/6, Nexus 4/5, ....). 

It could be used as starting point for your own development.
